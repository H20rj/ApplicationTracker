# Acceptance Tracker
## Must have: Python 3.13, pip

## How to use:
### Clone the git repository into a folder on computer
### Open python in the directory and run 
### Windows: `py main.py`
### macOS: `python3 main.py`


### Required Modules:
  
- `colorama`: For colorful terminal output

Once successful authentication with the default credentials, the user will be able to change the pass word to their own.

### Inside the application you can:
1. View your statuses for applications (once set)
2. Change application statuses
3. Stay secure with a username and password

## Installation and Running the Program

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required modules (as mentioned above).
3. Open the cloned directory in terminal.
4. Run the Python script using the run.sh file.






## About

This project was created on a sick day at school. It may not be fully optimized, but itâ€™s a good starting point for tracking acceptances.

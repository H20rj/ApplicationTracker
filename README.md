# Acceptance Tracker


## Installation:
### 1. Run setup.sh file by navigating to the file directory in terminal, then typing sh, and then dragging the setup.sh file into the terminal window.
### 2. Ensure modules have been properly installed.
### 3. Run app.sh file inside the directory with terminal by typing sh and then dragging app.sh in to the terminal window.



## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have installed the required Python modules.

### Required Modules:
  
- `colorama`: For colorful terminal output
- `pwinput`: For securely handling password input

To install these dependencies, run the setup.sh file in the directory.
This will automagically install the needed modules.



## Usage

The application uses a default username and password:

- **Username**: `user`
- **Password**: `password`

After entering the correct credentials, you will be able to use the application to track acceptances.
Once successful authentication with the default credentials, the user will be able to change the pass word to their own.

### Inside the application you can:
1. View your statuses for applications (once set)
2. Change application statuses
3. Stay secure with a username and password

## Installation and Running the Program

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required modules (as mentioned above).
3. Open the cloned directory in terminal.
4. Run the Python script using the run.sh file.






## About

This project was created on a sick day at school. It may not be fully optimized, but it’s a good starting point for tracking acceptances.
